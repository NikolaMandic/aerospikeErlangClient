C Client Installation for Linux

libc and openssl packages must be installed to compile the client library.

For Debian-based distributions, execute:

    sudo apt-get install libc6-dev libssl-dev

For redhat derived distributions such as Fedora Core and Centos, excute:

    sudo yum install openssl-devel glibc-devel

Installation of these packages will also install gcc. 
gcc -version must show a version of 4.1 or better. 
g++ is also supported with the same version restriction.

The C client can be built with the default Makefile:

    make

A static (libcitrusleaf.a) and dynamic (libcitrusleaf-<version>.so.1) library 
will be created in the lib directory.  Static linking prevents you from having 
to install the libraries on your target platform. Dynamic linking avoids a 
client rebuild if you upgrade the client.  Choose the option that is right for 
you.

The root level 'Makefile' automatically executed make -f src/Makefile.native , which uses
that GCC -march=noarch as a compilation target. Other examples, such as src/Makefile.32 and 
src/Makefile.64, build explicitly for 32 and 64 bit environments.
